# REST CLI

Keyboard-driven TUI for testing HTTP endpoints.

## Why?

Manage API calls using directory and file structure instead of massive JSON files.

No more merge conflicts. No more outdated collections. Each endpoint is a file. Git-friendly. Team-friendly.

## Features

1. File-based requests (`.http`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.jsonc`)
2. Variable substitution with `{{varName}}` and shell commands `$(cmd)`
3. Multi-value variables with aliases
4. Profile system for header and variable management
5. OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and mTLS support
6. Response filtering with JMESPath or bash/Linux commands
7. Response pinning and diff for regression testing
8. Request history and embedded documentation
9. CLI mode for scripting (JSON/YAML output)
10. cURL and OpenAPI converters
